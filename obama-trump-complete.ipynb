    "**Word embeddings** are a way of encoding words into n-dimensional vectors with continuous values so that the vector contains some information about the words' meanings. **Embedded word vectors** are often more useful than **one-hot vectors** in natural language processing applications, because the vectors themselves contain some embedded information about the word's meaning, instead of just identifying which word is there. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, similar words (e.g. \"him\" and \"her\") tend to have similar embedded vectors, whereas if we were just using one-hot vectors (i.e. only one \"1\" for \"him\" and one \"1\" for \"her\"), no notion of the words' actual meanings would be conveyed. Although this may sound crazy at first, word embeddings can even convey relationships between analogous words: for example: `king-man+womanâ‰ˆqueen`.\n",
